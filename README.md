Here's a detailed and professional `README.md` for your GitHub repo based on the code and pipeline you’ve shared. It assumes your repository is for a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** project using **PyTorch Geometric** and **MNIST Superpixels** dataset.

# MNIST Superpixels with GCN using PyTorch Geometric

This project implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the [MNIST Superpixels](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.MNISTSuperpixels.html) dataset using the [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) library. The goal is to classify MNIST digits represented as superpixel-based graphs.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Graph construction from MNIST images using superpixels
- Custom GCN model using `GCNConv` layers
- Global mean and max pooling
- Training loop with loss tracking
- Embedding visualization using matplotlib
- Simple evaluation and prediction

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- 1 Initial GCN layer: `GCNConv(1 → 64)`
- 3 Hidden GCN layers: `GCNConv(64 → 64)`
- Global Mean and Max Pooling
- Output layer: `Linear(128 → 10)`

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies (specific to PyTorch 1.6 and CPU):

```bash
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.12.0+cpu.html
pip install torch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0
````

Note: Make sure to uninstall any conflicting PyTorch versions before installing 1.6.0.

---

## 🚀 Training

To train the model:

```python
python gcn_mnist.py
```

During training:

* Train loss is printed every 10 epochs.
* Training runs for 500 epochs by default.
* Embeddings from GCN are extracted.

---

## 📊 Visualization

The learned graph embeddings can be visualized using scatter plots:

```python
visualize(embeddings, color=labels, epoch=..., loss=...)
```

You can also visualize graph structures using NetworkX:

```python
from torch_geometric.utils import to_networkx
G = to_networkx(sample, to_undirected=True)
visualize(G, color='red')
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

A simple test is performed after training:

```python
test_batch = next(iter(test_loader))
pred = model(test_batch.x, test_batch.edge_index, test_batch.batch)
```

Predicted vs actual labels can be printed and compared.

---

## 📉 Sample Output

```text
Epoch 0 | Train Loss: 1.37
...
Epoch 490 | Train Loss: 1.36
Actual Label: 0
Predicted Label: 1
```

---

## 📈 Loss Curve

Loss is tracked and visualized using seaborn:

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.lineplot(x=epoch_list, y=loss_values)
```

---

## 🛠️ Notes

* Make sure your Colab or system supports Python 3.7 (required by PyTorch 1.6).
* `nvidia-smi` might fail in Colab CPU runtime — that's expected.
* If using GPU, ensure CUDA version matches PyTorch build.
